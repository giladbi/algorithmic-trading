Evolutionary Computing
======================


**Description:**
We have two strategies in predicting
apple stock prices, one is through a 
genetic program, the other is through a
genetic algorithm. Follow the instructions
in the respective README's in sub repositories.


- Genetic Program: Rahul Ramakrishnan
	- Evolves a tree based population to minimize
	  the error between predicted price and actual price
	- Uses signals from nasdaq, apple, s&p, and soon to 
          be more. 

- Genetic Algorithm: Tushar Dadlani
	- Evolves a bit string population to guess if the 
	  next day's stock will go up or down.
